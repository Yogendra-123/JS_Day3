            <h3>2.What are arrow functions?</h3>
            <p>Arrow functions are introduced in Es6.In Js arrow functions are called as fat arrow functions.These 
                are a new way of writing compare to normal functions.Arrow functions are stored in a variable and it allows us to use fat arrow => operator. we can omit curly braces and function and return key words in arrow functions.</p>

                    result=x*y;

                   })

            <h3>3.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
            <pre>
                <li>Undefined is a datatype in JS which means a variable is declared but its value is not specified. It is also the default value of a variable declared using 'var' upon hoisting.</li>
                <li>Not defined is shown on the console when a variable is used for something but it was never declared.</li>
                <li>NAN stands for 'not a number' which is the value given to a number if it contains alphabets or any special character.</li>

            <h3>4.What is callback hell</h3>
            <p>callback hell is a pattern with multiple nested call backs which makes code hard to read and debug the code when we are dealing with asynchrous logic.The callback hell looks like a pyramid structure.</p>

            <h3>5.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h3>
            <p>Self Ivoking Function is also called as IIFE. IIFE(Immediatly Invoked function expression) is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined and it is an anonymous function.The signature of it given below:
            The primary reason to use IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared with in IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world.If u try to access them it throws error.

            <h3>6.What is the use of setTimeout</h3>
            <p>
                setTimeout() is a method inside the window object,it calls the specified function or evaluates a JS experssin after a given timeperiod for only once.We use this method to delay some kind of executions.Ex:alarms,remainders.
